Support for this course will mainly be provided through scheduled sessions. For an overview of when the sessions take place, see the [online timetable](https://timetables.eur.nl/schedule). Moreover, additional help can be obtained by posting questions on the course `Canvas Discussion Board` page.

### Live sessions
Due to the circumstances last year, the course used a format with lecture videos in addition to weekly 'live sessions'. This turned out to be a great success. So we will be repeating this format this year. The live sessions will generally consist of the following parts:
- General announcements and thoughts about the topics of the week
- live programming 
- Q&A (using padlet)

In the first week, the focus of the Q&A will be the setup of the course. The question hours last up to 1 hour and 45 minutes (depending on the amount of questions), and take place through  `Microsoft Teams`. You will automatically be added to the Teams page of this course, from where the question hour will be started. For installing and logging in to Teams, see the [manuals provided by the University](https://my.eur.nl/en/eur/ict-1/teams-chat-and-presence). 

### Explanation videos
Every week has a series of videos that become available on Monday through Canvas. Most videos are around 10-20 minutes in length, and each video discusses a topic from that week. You are recommended to watch the videos on Monday, as they are intended to get you started with the material of the week, and provide some further depth. After watching the videos, you should be well prepared to go through the material and practice exercises of the week.

### Tutorials
Each week there is a tutorial, where there will be a TA present to help you with questions regarding the practice exercises, homework assignments, or any general questions about the material. The idea is that you will work on the exercises during the tutorial. However, it is expected that you have already worked on the material of the week and prepared some questions. The tutorials will take place on campus. Though depending on the circumstances, they may partially take place through  `Microsoft Teams`. In the first week, we plan to offer some additional support to help everyone get started.

### Discussion Board
If additional question pop up, that you were not be able to ask during the question hour or tutorial sessions, you can ask them on the `Canvas Discussion Board` of the course. We will try to regularly check the discussion board and answer any questions that pop-up. Note that if you ask a question here, all students in the course can see it and benefit from the answer. However, this also means that you have to make sure not to include any personal information or any part of a solution for an assignment in these questions.

### Email
For any personal matters you should [send an email](mailto:feb21011@ese.eur.nl). Email is not intended for asking questions about the assignments or content of the course: such emails will be ignored.
