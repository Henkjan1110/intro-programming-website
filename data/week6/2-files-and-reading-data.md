Handling data is a fundamental aspect of software development. Many applications, such as music players and image editors, work by processing data in the form of music or image files. Even internet and mobile applications like Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram operate by handling user information stored in file-based databases. Regardless of the specific application, software must read and manipulate data to carry out its intended functions.

In all of these cases, the data being handled is ultimately stored in one or more files, often in a specific file format. This means that understanding how to work with files and file formats is an essential skill for software developers. By efficiently managing and manipulating data, software can provide valuable and meaningful experiences to users.

## Reading From the Keyboard

Throughout this course, we have been using the `Scanner` class to read user input. Typically, we use a while-true loop to continuously read input until we encounter a specific input that signals the end of the input block.

```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

while (true) {
    String line = scanner.nextLine();

    if (line.equals("end")) {
        break;
    }

    // add the read line to a list for later
    // handling or handle the line immediately

}
```

Text-based user interfaces typically direct user input into the input stream one line at a time. In the previous example, we used the `Scanner` class to read user input and passed the system input stream (`System.in`) as a parameter to its constructor.

By default, the `Scanner` class reads user input as strings. If we want to handle the input as a different data type, such as integers, we must convert it to the appropriate form. For example, consider the program below, which reads user input until the user enters "end". As long as the input is not "end", it is treated as an integer and printed to the console:

```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

while (true) {
    String row = scanner.nextLine();

    if (row.equals("end")) {
        break;
    }

    int number = Integer.parseInt(row);
    System.out.println(row);
}
```

<programming-exercise name='Cubes'>

Write a program that reads strings from the user until the user inputs the string "end". As long as the input is not "end", the program should handle the input as an integer and print the cube of the number provided (i.e., number * number * number). Below are some sample outputs

<sample-output>

**3**
27
**-1**
-1
**11**
1331
**end**

</sample-output>

<sample-output>

**end**

</sample-output>

## Files and the Filesystem

**Files** are collections of data that reside on computers and can contain various types of content, such as text, images, or music, depending on their format. The file format specifies the content of the file as well as the program required to read it. For example, PDF files require a PDF reader, and music files require a media player. Programmers are responsible for specifying the file format as part of their work in creating these programs.

Computers have different programs for browsing files, which are specific to the operating system. These programs make use of the computer's filesystem in various ways. In IntelliJ, you can browse the files of a project by selecting the "Project Files" tab, located alongside the "Projects" tab. You can also see the project files in the "Projects" tab along with the code. This provides a convenient way to manage and view the files associated with your project.

<text-box type="info" name="The Concrete File Storage Format">

Files are essentially collections of data that reside on a computer's hard drive, which is essentially a massive series of ones and zeroes (i.e., bits) that store information. For example, a single variable of type "int" takes up 32 bits (i.e., 32 ones or zeroes), while modern terabyte-sized hard drives hold about 8 trillion bits (or 8,000,000,000,000).

Despite their potentially massive size, files can be located almost anywhere on a hard drive, and they can even be split into multiple pieces. The computer's **filesystem** is responsible for keeping track of the locations of files on the hard drive, as well as for creating new files and modifying existing ones. Essentially, the filesystem acts as an abstraction layer that hides the underlying structure of the hard drive, allowing users and programs to access files without needing to know how or where they are actually stored.

## Reading From a File

To read a file in Java, the `Scanner` class is used. To read a specific file, the path of that file is provided to the constructor of the `Scanner` object. The path to the file can be obtained using the `Paths.get` method, which takes the name of the file as a string parameter: `Paths.get("filename.extension")`.

Once the `Scanner` object has been created, the file can be read using a while-loop until all lines in the file have been read. However, reading a file may result in an error, which is why the process requires separate try and catch blocks to handle potential errors. Further details about handling errors during file reading will not be covered in this course.

```java
// first
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

// in the program:

// we create a scanner for reading the file
try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(Paths.get("file.txt"))) {

    // we read the file until all lines have been read
    while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {
        // we read one line
        String row = scanner.nextLine();
        // we print the line that we read
        System.out.println(row);
    }
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

A file is read from the project root by default (when `new Scanner(Paths.get("file.txt"))` is called), i.e., the folder that contains the folder `src` (and possibly other files as well). The contents of this folder can the inspected using the `Project Files`-tab in IntelliJ.

<programming-exercise name='Printing a Specified File'>

Write a program that asks the user for a string, and then prints the contents of a file with a name matching the string provided. You may assume that the user provides a file name that the program can find.

The exercise template contains the files "data.txt" and "song.txt", which you may use when testing the functionality of your program. The output of the program can be seen below for when a user has entered the string "song.txt". The content that is printed comes from the file "song.txt". Naturally, the program should also work with other filenames, assuming the file can be found.

<sample-output>

Which file should have its contents printed?
**song.txt**
No option for duality
The old is where we come
Clockspeed is fast, but we'll survive
The new will overcome
We are challengers, not followers
We take the ball to build
Easy safe services
Are here to stay

Value for society
Value for life
For you and me
Tieto is here allright!

</sample-output>

</programming-exercise>

In the example below, we read all the lines of the file "file.txt", which are then added to a List.

```java
List<String> lines = new ArrayList<>();

// we create a scanner for reading the file
try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(Paths.get("file.txt"))) {

    // we read all the lines of the file
    while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {
        lines.add(scanner.nextLine());
    }
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
}

// we print the total number of lines
System.out.println("Total lines: " + lines.size());
```

<programming-exercise name='Numbers From a File'>

Write a program that prompts the user for a filename, as well as the upper and lower bounds for the accepted range of numbers. The then program reads the numbers contained in the file (each number is on its own line) and only accounts for the numbers which are inside the given range. Finally, the program should print the number of numbers that were inside the given range.

You can convert a string-type integer read from a file into a proper integer using the command `Integer.valueOf` (just as when handling input from a user).

<sample-output>

File? **numbers-1.txt**
Lower bound? **15**
Upper bound? **20**
Numbers: 2

</sample-output>

<sample-output>

File? **numbers-1.txt**
Lower bound? **0**
Upper bound? **300**
Numbers: 4

</sample-output>

**NB**! The exercise template comes with two files, `numbers-1.txt` and `numbers-2.txt` that have the following contents. Do not change the contents of these files.

numbers-1.txt:

<sample-data>

300
9
20
15

</sample-data>

numbers-2.txt:

<sample-data>

123
-5
12
67
-300
1902

</sample-data>

</programming-exercise>

<text-box typie="hint" name="An Empty Line In a File">

Sometimes an empty line finds it way into a file. Skipping an empty line can be done using the command `continue` and the `isEmpty`-method of the string.

In the example below, we read from a file

Reading data is straightforward.

```java
// we create a scanner for reading the file
try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(Paths.get("henkilot.csv"))) {

    // we read all the lines of the file
    while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {
        String line = scanner.nextLine();

        // if the line is blank we do nothing
        if (line.isEmpty()) {
            continue;
        }

        // do something with the data

    }
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

## Reading Data of a Specific Format From a File

The world is filled with data that is related to other data, forming collections. For example, personal information can include a name, date of birth, and a phone number. Address information, on the other hand, can include a country, city, street address, postal code, and so on.

Often, data is stored in files using a specific format. One such format that we are already familiar with is comma-separated values (CSV) format, where data is separated by commas.

```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

while (true) {
    System.out.print("Enter name and age separated by a comma: ");
    String line = scanner.nextLine();

    if (line.equals("")) {
        break;
    }

    String[] parts = line.split(",");
    String name = parts[0];
    int age = Integer.valueOf(parts[1]);

    System.out.println("Name: " + name);
    System.out.println("Age: " + age);
}
```

The program works as follows:

<sample-output>

Enter name and age separated by a comma:
**virpi,19**
Name: virpi
Age: 19
Enter name and age separated by a comma:
**jenna,21**
Name: jenna
Age: 21
Enter name and age separated by a comma:
**ada,20**
Name: ada
Age: 20

</sample-output>

Reading the same data from a file called `records.txt` would look like this:

```java
try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(Paths.get("records.txt"))) {

    while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {
        String line = scanner.nextLine();

        String[] parts = line.split(",");
        String name = parts[0];
        int age = Integer.valueOf(parts[1]);

        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
    }
}
```

<programming-exercise name='Records From a File'>

In this exercise, we'll be working with files stored in CSV-format that contain names and ages separated by commas. The file format could look like this:

<sample-data>

lily,3
anton,5
levi,4
amy,1

</sample-data>

Your task is to write a program that first prompts the user for the name of the file they want to read. The program then prints the content of the file in the following way (we're assuming that the output is from the above-mentioned file):

<sample-output>

Name of the file:
**data.txt**
lily, age: 3 years
anton, age: 5 years
levi, age: 4 years
amy, age: 1 year

</sample-output>

**NB**! The word "year" should be formatted based on the age.

</programming-exercise>

## Reading Objects From a File

Creating objects from data that is read from a file is straightforward. Let's assume that we have a class called `Person`, as well as the data from before.

Reading objects can be done like so:

```java
List<Person> people = new ArrayList<>();

try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(Paths.get("records.txt"))) {

    while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {
        String line = scanner.nextLine();

        String[] parts = line.split(",");
        String name = parts[0];
        int age = Integer.valueOf(parts[1]);

        people.add(new Person(name, age));
    }
}

System.out.println("Total amount of people read: " + people.size());
```

Reading objects from a file is a clear responsibility in and of itself, and should for that reason be isolated into a method. This is what we'll be doing in the next exercise.

<programming-exercise name='Storing Records'>

In this exercise, we'll be working with files stored in CSV format, which contain names and ages separated by commas. The file format may look like this:

<sample-data>

lily,3
anton,5
levi,4
amy,1

</sample-data>

The exercise template already has a `Person` class, and the class `StoringRecords` has a body for the method `public static List<Person> readRecordsFromFile(String file)`. Implement the `readRecordsFromFile` method such that it reads the persons from the file passed as a parameter, and finally returns them in the list returned by the method.

The exercise template has a `main` method that you can use to test how your program works. In this exercise, only modify the method `readRecordsFromFile`.
